Declarative configuration or imperative scripting architecture
===============================================================


Declarative configuration and imperative scripting are two different approaches to defining and managing infrastructure or automation processes.

Declarative Configuration
==========================

Definition: 
============
Specifies what the final state should be without defining how to achieve it.

Example Tools: 
===============
Terraform, Kubernetes YAML manifests, CloudFormation, Ansible (to some extent).

Pros:
======
Idempotency – Running the configuration multiple times results in the same desired state.
Easier Maintenance – More readable and predictable.
Automation-Friendly – Works well with GitOps and CI/CD workflows.

Cons:
======
Less Flexibility – Difficult to implement conditional logic.
Abstracted Execution – Less visibility into the steps being executed.

Example (Terraform for EC2 instance creation):
===============================================

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = "ami-12345678"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  tags = {
    Name = "MyWebServer"
  }
}


Imperative Scripting
=====================

Definition: 
============
Specifies how to achieve a result step by step.

Example Tools:
===============
Bash scripts, Python scripts, AWS CLI commands, Jenkins pipelines.

Pros:
======
Fine-Grained Control – You define exactly what happens and when.
Better for Procedural Tasks – Great for complex workflows and conditional logic.

Cons:
======
Prone to Errors – Each execution may lead to different states if not handled properly.
Harder to Maintain – Scripts grow complex over time.

Example (Bash script to launch an EC2 instance):
=================================================

#!/bin/bash

aws ec2 run-instances --image-id ami-12345678 --count 1 --instance-type t2.micro --key-name MyKeyPair --security-groups MySecurityGroup


When to Use Each Approach
==========================

-> Use declarative configuration for infrastructure as code (IaC), container orchestration, and managing infrastructure in a predictable way.
-> Use imperative scripting for ad-hoc automation, dynamic workflows, and tasks that require step-by-step execution.
-> In many cases, both approaches can be combined (e.g., using Terraform for infrastructure provisioning and Ansible scripts for configuration management).

Since you're working with Jenkins and Terraform, a declarative approach with Terraform for provisioning and Jenkins pipelines for automation (with some imperative scripting inside) is a good choice. Let me know if you need specific examples!
